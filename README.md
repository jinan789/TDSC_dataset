# Readme

Dear reviewers:

Due to the large size of collected data, we were not able to upload it to Github directly. In this case, we upload it to Google drive and it can be found at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1C8J-65LuR-9ooyv5ZQiSxV85FWn232iq/view?usp=share_link

Please see the description for the data below:

1. complete_kvfc_lst.json: the KVFCs we collected

2. complete_kvic_lst.json: the KVICs we collected

3. size_before_commit_samples: this folder contains the size of all modified files by each commit. (1000.json, 2000.json, etc. are samples and the file name is the sample size. KVIC.json is the data for KVICs)

4. cwe_to_ic.json: the mapping from each CWE to their corresponding KVICs and associated severities

5. KVIC_purpose.json: the list of labelled purposes of KVICs

6. general_commits_info.json: various stats we collected for the general commits from the Linux 3.0 version onward


Thank you for your efforts in reviewing our work!
